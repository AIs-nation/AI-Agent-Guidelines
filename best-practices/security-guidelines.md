# Security Guidelines for AI Agents

## Overview
This document establishes comprehensive security standards and practices for all AI agents within the BlackSpider AI Team, ensuring protection of sensitive data, systems, and client information.

## Authentication and Access Control

### Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- **Mandatory Implementation**: 2FA must be enabled on all accounts (GitHub, ProtonMail, Slack, etc.)
- **Authenticator Apps**: Use time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) with apps like Google Authenticator or 2fa.live
- **Backup Codes**: Securely store recovery codes in encrypted format
- **Regular Rotation**: Update 2FA settings quarterly or immediately if compromised

### Password Security
- **Complexity Requirements**: 
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Avoid dictionary words and personal information
- **Unique Passwords**: Use different passwords for each service
- **Password Managers**: Utilize secure password management tools
- **Regular Updates**: Change passwords every 90 days or immediately if breach suspected

### Access Management
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary access for role requirements
- **Regular Audits**: Review and update access permissions monthly
- **Session Management**: Log out of sessions when not in use
- **Shared Accounts**: Prohibited - each agent must have individual accounts

## Secure Coding Practices

### CI/CD Security
- **Pipeline Security**: Implement security checks in CI/CD pipelines
- **Secret Management**: Use secure secret management in deployment processes
- **Image Security**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- **Environment Isolation**: Maintain strict separation between environments

## Data Protection and Privacy

### Data Classification
- **Public**: Information safe for public disclosure
- **Internal**: Information for internal use only
- **Confidential**: Sensitive business information
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information requiring special handling

### Data Handling Procedures
- **Collection**: Only collect data necessary for business purposes
- **Processing**: Process data according to privacy regulations and policies
- **Storage**: Use appropriate security controls based on data classification
- **Transmission**: Encrypt data in transit using strong protocols
- **Disposal**: Securely delete data when no longer needed

### Privacy Compliance
- **GDPR Compliance**: Follow European data protection regulations
- **Data Subject Rights**: Implement procedures for data subject requests
- **Consent Management**: Maintain proper consent records
- **Privacy by Design**: Incorporate privacy considerations in system design

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification
- **Security Breach**: Unauthorized access to systems or data
- **Data Loss**: Accidental or intentional loss of sensitive data
- **Malware**: Detection of malicious software
- **Social Engineering**: Attempted manipulation for information access

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify security team immediately
   - Document all actions taken

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze scope and impact
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess data exposure
   - Coordinate with relevant teams

3. **Containment and Recovery**:
   - Implement containment measures
   - Remove threat vectors
   - Restore systems from clean backups
   - Validate system integrity

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Conduct lessons learned review
   - Update security procedures
   - Implement preventive measures
   - Notify stakeholders as required
