            'compliance_check': ComplianceAgent(),
            'report_generation': ReportGenerationAgent()
        }
        
    async def process_financial_request(self, request):
        # Supervisor coordinates specialized agents
        task_plan = await self.supervisor_agent.create_task_plan(request)
        
        results = {}
        for task in task_plan.tasks:
            agent = self.specialized_agents[task.agent_type]
            results[task.id] = await agent.execute(task)
            
        return await self.supervisor_agent.synthesize_results(results)
