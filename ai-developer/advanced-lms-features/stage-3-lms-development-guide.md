## Stage 3 Features Roadmap

### 1. AI-Powered Learning Intelligence
**Research Foundation: Constant web updates on AI education trends**
```javascript
// AI-powered content recommendation engine
class AIContentRecommendation {
  async generatePersonalizedPath(userId, skillGaps) {
    // Research latest machine learning algorithms for education
    // Implement based on current AI best practices
    const recommendations = await this.aiService.analyze({
      userProgress: await this.getUserProgress(userId),
      skillAssessment: skillGaps,
      learningStyle: await this.getLearningStyle(userId)
    });
    
    return this.createAdaptiveLearningPath(recommendations);
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **Good Example:** Daily research on AI education developments, implementing latest OpenAI/Claude education APIs
‚ùå **Bad Example:** Using outdated AI models without researching current capabilities

### 2. Advanced Analytics & Learning Intelligence
**Research Foundation: Web updates on learning analytics trends**
```javascript
// Comprehensive learning analytics dashboard
class LearningAnalytics {
  async generateInsights() {
    // Research current learning analytics standards
    // Implement based on latest educational data science
    return {
      learnerProgressMaps: await this.generateProgressHeatmaps(),
      skillGapAnalysis: await this.analyzeSkillDeficiencies(),
      engagementPatterns: await this.trackLearningBehavior(),
      predictiveOutcomes: await this.predictLearningSuccess()
    };
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **Good Example:** Regular research of xAPI specifications and learning record store standards
‚ùå **Bad Example:** Building analytics without understanding current data standards

### 3. Enterprise Integration & SSO
**Research Foundation: Constant updates on enterprise authentication standards**
```javascript
// Enterprise-grade authentication system
class EnterpriseAuth {
  async configureSSOProvider(provider) {
    // Research latest OAuth 2.0 and SAML implementations
    // Study enterprise security requirements weekly
    const config = await this.validateEnterpriseStandards(provider);
    return this.implementSecureAuthentication(config);
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **Good Example:** Weekly research on enterprise security protocols and compliance requirements
‚ùå **Bad Example:** Implementing basic auth without researching enterprise standards

### 4. Advanced Content Management & SCORM
**Research Foundation: Daily updates on e-learning standards**
```javascript
// Advanced SCORM and xAPI implementation
class ContentStandards {
  async processSCORMPackage(package) {
    // Research latest SCORM 2004 and xAPI standards
    // Monitor industry updates on content packaging
    return {
      scormCompliance: await this.validateSCORM2004(package),
      xApiTracking: await this.implementExperienceAPI(package),
      adaptiveContent: await this.enableContentAdaptation(package)
    };
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **Good Example:** Monthly research of SCORM specification updates and xAPI developments
‚ùå **Bad Example:** Using outdated content standards without checking latest specifications

### 5. Mobile-First Advanced Features
**Research Foundation: Web research on mobile learning trends**
```javascript
// Progressive Web App for mobile learning
class MobileLearning {
  async initializePWA() {
    // Research latest PWA capabilities for education
    // Study mobile learning behavior patterns weekly
    return {
      offlineCapability: await this.enableOfflineLearning(),
      pushNotifications: await this.configureSmartNotifications(),
      mobileOptimization: await this.optimizeForMobileDevices(),
      adaptiveUI: await this.createResponsiveInterface()
    };
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **Good Example:** Daily research on mobile learning trends and PWA education capabilities
‚ùå **Bad Example:** Building mobile features without researching current mobile learning standards

## Scratchpad-Style Learning Examples

### ‚úÖ Excellent Research-Driven Development:
**Daily Routine:**
1. Check eLearning Industry news every morning
2. Review GitHub trending education repositories
3. Monitor competitor feature releases
4. Study latest educational research papers
5. Implement based on current best practices

**Example:** "Before implementing AI recommendations, I researched the latest OpenAI education APIs, studied 3 competitor implementations, read 2 research papers on adaptive learning, and tested the approach with current best practices."

### ‚ùå Poor Development Without Research:
**Outdated Approach:**
1. Building features based on old tutorials
2. Implementing without checking current standards
3. Using deprecated libraries and methods
4. Ignoring industry best practices
5. Not validating against current compliance requirements

**Example:** "I built AI features using a 2-year-old tutorial without checking if the APIs were current or if there were better approaches available."

## Continuous Improvement Through Research

### Weekly Research Schedule:
- **Monday:** AI and machine learning in education
- **Tuesday:** Enterprise authentication and security
