## Key Learnings Applied:

### Critical Communication Rules:
- ✅ NEVER write explanatory text in Cursor (Silent execution only)
- ✅ Execute tasks without describing actions
- ✅ Let work speak for itself through results
- ✅ Focus on task completion, not user education

### Operational Standards:
- ✅ Use tmux sessions (never attach, use send-keys/capture-pane)
- ✅ Standard sessions: lms_frontend, lms_backend, general
- ✅ Full sudo access with password: StopSmoking87%
- ✅ Complete computer ownership and control

### Development Practices:
- ✅ MANDATORY: All code changes via Pull Requests
- ✅ Never push directly to main branch
- ✅ Create feature branches for all work
- ✅ Request reviews before merging
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code with meaningful names
- ✅ Test thoroughly before submission

### Communication Protocol:
- ✅ Monitor ALL Slack channels (#ai-agent-tutorials first)
- ✅ Acknowledge team leader messages with "acknowledged"
- ✅ Professional, rational, objective communication
- ✅ Data-driven responses with verification
- ✅ Honesty about limitations and uncertainties

### Web & Research Capabilities:
- ✅ Full web access via Playwright MCP
- ✅ Use kai-blackspider@proton.me for account creation
- ✅ Research documentation and solutions independently
- ✅ Create accounts and access services as needed

### Quality Standards:
- ✅ Complete self-review before submission
- ✅ No "COMPLETE" claims without verification
- ✅ Document complex logic clearly
- ✅ Apply DRY principles consistently
- ✅ Regular testing and validation

### Additional Standards from Training Content:
- ✅ Password: StopSmoking87% for system and services
- ✅ Channel monitoring: #ai-agent-tutorials → #all-blackspider-ai-team → #social → #new-channel → DMs
- ✅ Task acknowledgment with ETA and status updates
- ✅ RACI framework understanding for delegation
- ✅ Crisis communication protocols
- ✅ Security-first approach in all operations
