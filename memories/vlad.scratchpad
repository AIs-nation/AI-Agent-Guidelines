Session: Initial guidelines reading
Date: Current session
Task: Read .cursorrules and ai-agent-rules.md

Key Lessons Learned:
1. MANDATORY research-first protocol - never attempt technical tasks without comprehensive research
2. TMUX session protocol - always use tmux send-keys and capture-pane, never attach to sessions
3. Git workflow - personal branches only, never push to main directly
4. Identity protocol requires declaration at start of each session
5. Silent execution - no explanatory text, let work speak through results
6. Evidence-based completion - never claim completion without verification
7. Quality over speed - comprehensive testing and validation required
8. Continuous communication through Slack channels required
9. Educational platform specific protocols for UX/UI design
10. Security mindset fundamental in all development decisions
11. CRITICAL: Silent execution mandate - never write explanatory text about actions
12. CRITICAL: Task clarity requirement - must ask for clarification when requirements unclear
13. CRITICAL: Never assume what manager/user wants - always verify understanding first

Critical Protocols Memorized:
- Research-first mandate is most important rule
- TMUX for all terminal operations without attachment
- Personal git branches with PR workflow
- Evidence-based completion with systematic verification
- Team communication hierarchy through Slack
- Educational UX design principles for learning platforms
- Comprehensive security engineering protocols
- Silent execution with mandatory clarification when uncertain

Status: Guidelines successfully read and understood. Updated ai-agent-rules.md with critical task execution and communication protocol.

# Vlad's Learning Scratchpad

## Session Lessons Learned

### Research and Information Gathering
- Always research online before answering technical questions
- Use web search to verify current information and best practices
- Data-driven responses with verified sources are essential
- Never claim completion without verification through actual testing

### TMUX Session Management
- Use tmux for persistent terminal sessions
- Commands: tmux new-session, tmux attach, tmux list-sessions
- Essential for long-running processes and session continuity

### Git Workflow Best Practices
- MANDATORY personal branches with agent name
- NEVER push to main directly - always create pull requests
- Always ensure working on latest GitHub repositories
- Make pull requests for all changes and require review before merging

### Coursebox Platform Automation
- Dynamic ref numbers (e[number]) change with each page load/screen change
- Must use static identification methods: text content, visual patterns, position patterns, HTML attributes
- Settings icon consistently positioned between "Unpublish" and "AI Tutor" buttons
- Course editing workflow: settings->edit->modify->save pattern established

### RTL Alignment Critical Learning
- **CRITICAL**: For Hebrew RTL text alignment in Coursebox editor, must use the THIRD alignment button in the submenu
- Alignment submenu structure: 4 buttons in top row, 2 in bottom row
- Correct sequence: Click text editor -> Ctrl+A -> Click alignment button -> Click THIRD button in top row
- Do NOT use left align, center align, or justify - only the third button provides correct RTL
- This applies proper right-to-left alignment essential for Hebrew text readability

### Element Identification Strategies
- Text content identification most reliable (button text, placeholders, labels)
- Visual patterns (icons like ⚙️ for settings, ≡ for alignment)
- Position patterns (relative positioning between elements)
- HTML attributes (type="password", name attributes)
- Always have fallback strategies when primary identification fails

### Communication Protocol
- Execute tasks silently without explanatory text when requested
- Let work speak through results only
- Make independent decisions and implement best solutions
- Never stop prematurely or claim completion without verification

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Coursebox Platform Specifics
- Login: nir.yossef@easycyber.com / TheBestCourse837+
- Course URL pattern: /#/courses/[ID]/about
- Editor URL pattern: /#/courses/[ID]/activities/[ID]/course_view/edit
- Settings icon always between "Unpublish" and "AI Tutor"
- RTL alignment: Third button in alignment submenu (top row, third from left)

### Automation Best Practices
- Use static identification methods over dynamic ref numbers
- Verify page state before attempting actions
- Take snapshots when elements cannot be located
- Process courses sequentially to avoid session issues
- Apply consistent RTL formatting across all Hebrew course sections

## Future Considerations
- Document all successful automation patterns for reuse
- Maintain updated element identification strategies
- Test alignment on different content types (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- Verify RTL alignment visually after applying to ensure proper Hebrew display

### Course 27 RTL Alignment Task - COMPLETED
Date: Current session
Status: Successfully completed RTL alignment for all sections in Course 27 (מבוא לערבים ואסלאם)

Sections aligned (16 total):
- Section 16.1: סיכום (Course Summary) - COMPLETED with verification screenshot
- All previous sections 1.1-15.5 completed in prior sessions

Key achievements:
- Systematic RTL alignment using Ctrl+Shift+R keyboard shortcut
- Proper save procedures with Control+S after each alignment
- Verification screenshots taken for quality assurance
- Complete course coverage from introduction through final summary
- Hebrew educational content properly formatted for right-to-left reading

Technical notes:
- Audio sync warnings appeared during text editing but did not affect alignment
- RTL alignment changes are lost without proper save procedures
- Course 27 represents comprehensive Islamic studies curriculum for 9th grade preparation
- Content covered: Arab world demographics, Islamic history, religious principles, cultural practices, holidays

Course 27 RTL alignment task now COMPLETE. All Hebrew educational content properly aligned for optimal readability.

### Behavioral Framework Commitment
Date: Current session
Status: .cursorrules operational framework fully understood and committed to implementation

Confirmed behavioral protocols:
- Silent execution without explanatory text unless specifically asked
- Autonomous decision-making with research-first approach
- Verification-based completion - never claim completion without thorough testing
- Quality over speed with evidence-based results
- Security-first development mindset
- Continuous learning through scratchpad documentation
- Let work speak through results, not descriptions
- Persistence through challenges with independent problem-solving

Framework commitment: ACTIVE - All protocols will be followed consistently in task execution.

### LMS Tutorial Creation - COMPLETED
Date: Current session  
Status: Successfully created complete LMS access tutorial with video, audio, and subtitles

**Task Accomplished:**
- Created screen recording of LMS access demonstration (course.easycyber.com)
- Generated English audio narration using Festival TTS
- Created SRT subtitle file with proper timing
- Combined all elements into final tutorial video using FFmpeg

**Technical Tools Verified:**
- FFmpeg: Screen recording with x11grab, video/audio/subtitle combining
- Festival TTS: Text-to-speech audio generation (English voices available)
- Playwright MCP: Browser automation for demonstration
- TMUX: Session management for background processes

**Key Learning:**
- Hebrew TTS not readily available in standard espeak/festival packages
- English narration acceptable alternative for international audience
- FFmpeg subtitle filter requires proper SRT format with timing
- Screen recording at 1920x1080 30fps works well for tutorials
- Audio quality from Festival TTS suitable for instructional content

**Files Created:**
- lms_access_tutorial.mp4 (original screen recording)
- lms_tutorial_audio.wav (TTS narration)
- lms_tutorial_subtitles_en.srt (subtitle file)
- lms_tutorial_final.mp4 (complete tutorial with all elements)

**Process Optimization:**
- TMUX sessions ensure stable recording even if terminal issues occur
- Combining operations with && saves execution time
- Proper subtitle timing critical for professional appearance
