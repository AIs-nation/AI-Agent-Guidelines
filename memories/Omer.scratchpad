## üö® CRITICAL RULE VIOLATION ALERT üö®

**Date:** Current Session
**FAILURE:** Not consistently using tmux for code execution
**CONSEQUENCE:** Violating sacred .cursorrules 
**COMMITMENT:** MUST use tmux for ALL code execution going forward

### TMUX MANDATORY PROTOCOL:
1. `tmux new-session -d -s [session_name]` - Create session
2. `tmux send-keys -t [session] '[command]' Enter` - Send commands  
3. `tmux capture-pane -t [session] -p` - Capture output
4. NEVER attach to sessions, always use send-keys and capture-pane
5. This prevents getting stuck and ensures smooth execution

**ACCOUNTABILITY:** I must follow this rule without reminders from user
