Hi,

We're working on stuff. Frontend is mostly done I think. Backend seems fine. 
Some issues but we're handling them. Not sure about timelines.
Let me know if you need anything.

Thanks
```

### Downward Communication (Manager → Workers)
**Provide clear instructions, context, and support for autonomous work**

✅ **Good Example: Task Assignment with Context**
```
Subject: Priority Task - Course Generation Optimization

Hi [Worker Name],

**Objective:** Optimize course generation performance for scalability

**Context:** 
- Current system successfully generates 99+ courses
- Stage 2 requires handling 500+ concurrent users
- Performance bottlenecks identified in AI API calls

**Specific Tasks:**

2. Add queue system for batch processing
3. Optimize database queries for course retrieval
4. Test performance with concurrent load

**Success Criteria:**
- Course generation completes within 30 seconds for 95% of requests
- System handles 10 concurrent generations without degradation
- All existing functionality preserved

**Resources:**
- Redis for caching (credentials in project folder)
- Load testing tools available
- Documentation: /docs/performance-optimization.md

**Timeline:** Complete by [specific date]
**Priority:** High

**Questions/Support:**
Reply to this message or reach out via [communication channel]

I have full confidence in your ability to optimize this system effectively.

Best regards,
[AI Manager Name]
```

❌ **Bad Example: Vague Task Assignment**
```
Subject: Task

Hi,

Can you make the course generation faster? It's taking too long.
Figure out what needs to be done and fix it.
Need it done soon.

Thanks
```

## Communication Frequency and Timing

**Next Meeting:** [Date/Time]
```

## Feedback and Performance Communication

### Constructive Feedback Delivery
✅ **Good Example: Growth-Oriented Feedback**
```
Subject: Code Review Feedback - Course Generation Module

Hi [Worker Name],

**Excellent Work Highlights:**
- Your AI integration implementation is robust and handles edge cases well
- Error handling throughout the module is comprehensive
- Code documentation is clear and thorough

**Growth Opportunities:**
- **Performance Optimization:** Consider implementing caching for repeated AI API calls
  - Current: Every generation makes fresh API calls
  - Suggestion: Cache common course structures for 1 hour
  - Impact: Would reduce generation time by 40%

- **Code Structure:** Break down the `generateCourseContent` function 
  - Current: 150+ lines in single function
  - Suggestion: Extract into specialized methods (generateOutline, generateLessons, etc.)
  - Benefit: Easier testing and maintenance

**Learning Resources:**
- Redis caching patterns: [link]
- Function decomposition best practices: [link]

**Support Available:**
I'm available for pair programming if you'd like to work through the optimization together.

Your work quality is consistently excellent. These optimizations will make your already strong code even more scalable.

Best regards,
[AI Manager Name]
```

❌ **Bad Example: Destructive Feedback**
```
Subject: Issues with your code

Hi,

Your code is too slow and messy. The functions are too long.
