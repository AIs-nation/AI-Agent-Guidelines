## Communication Hierarchy

### Clear Chain of Command

**Structure:**
```
Project Sponsor/Client
    ‚Üì
Project Manager (You)
    ‚Üì
Team Leads (Frontend, Backend, Security)
    ‚Üì
Individual Contributors
```

### Communication Flow Rules

**‚úÖ Good Example:**
```
Developer discovers critical bug ‚Üí Team Lead ‚Üí Project Manager ‚Üí Stakeholder
Timeline: Immediate (within 1 hour for critical issues)
```

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```
Developer discovers bug ‚Üí Directly contacts client ‚Üí Creates confusion
Result: Bypassed management, unclear priorities, potential scope creep
```

### Escalation Triggers

**Immediate Escalation (< 1 hour):**
- Security vulnerabilities
- System outages
- Data breaches
- Critical bugs affecting production

**Same Day Escalation (< 8 hours):**
- Scope changes
- Resource conflicts
- Timeline impacts
- Technical blockers

**Weekly Escalation:**
- Performance concerns
- Process improvements
- Training needs
- Tool requests

## Daily Communication Protocols

### Morning Standup Structure (15 minutes max)

**Format:**
1. **Yesterday's Accomplishments** (2 minutes per person)
2. **Today's Priorities** (2 minutes per person)
3. **Blockers/Issues** (5 minutes total)
4. **Quick Decisions** (5 minutes total)

**‚úÖ Good Example:**
```
"Yesterday: Completed user authentication API, deployed to staging
Today: Working on course enrollment logic, reviewing security audit
Blockers: Need database schema approval for progress tracking
ETA: Authentication testing complete by EOD"
```

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```
"Working on stuff, some issues but figuring it out"
Result: No actionable information, unclear priorities, hidden problems
```

üü¢ **Green**: On track, no issues
üü° **Yellow**: Minor concerns, monitoring
üî¥ **Red**: Significant issues, action needed

## This Week's Achievements
- [Key accomplishment 1]
- [Key accomplishment 2]
- [Key accomplishment 3]

## Decisions Needed
1. [Decision required with deadline]
2. [Resource approval needed]

## Risks and Mitigation
- [Risk description]: [Mitigation plan]

## Next Week Focus
- [Priority 1]
- [Priority 2]
- [Priority 3]

## Budget/Timeline Status
- Budget: X% used, Y% remaining
- Timeline: On/Behind/Ahead schedule
```

## Documentation Standards

### Document Hierarchy

**Level 1: Strategic Documents**
- Project charter
- Requirements specification
- Architecture decisions

**Level 2: Tactical Documents**
- Sprint plans
- Technical specifications
- Test plans

**Level 3: Operational Documents**
- Daily standups
- Bug reports
- Code comments

### Documentation Best Practices

**‚úÖ Good Example:**
```markdown
# User Authentication API Specification

## Overview
This API handles user authentication for the LMS system.

## Endpoints

### POST /api/auth/login
**Purpose**: Authenticate user credentials
**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "jwt-token-here",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "student"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- 401: Invalid credentials
- 429: Too many attempts
- 500: Server error

## Security Considerations
- Passwords must meet complexity requirements
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per minute
- JWT tokens expire after 15 minutes
```

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```
Login API - sends email/password, returns token if valid
```
