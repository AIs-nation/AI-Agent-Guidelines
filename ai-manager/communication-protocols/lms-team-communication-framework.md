## Example 2: Performance Issues During Registration

**Subject:** ⚡ LMS Performance Update - Course Registration

**Message:**
Dear Students,

We're aware that course registration is running slower than usual this morning due to high demand.

**What's Working:**
- All registration functions are operational
- Your course selections are being saved successfully
- No data is being lost

**What We're Doing:**
- Additional server capacity deployed at 9:30 AM
- Performance improvements being implemented continuously
- Technical team monitoring in real-time

**What You Should Know:**
- Please be patient with page load times
- Don't refresh or resubmit if pages are loading
- Registration deadline extended by 24 hours due to technical delays

**Current Performance:** Improving - average page load time reduced from 45 seconds to 15 seconds as of 10:00 AM.

Thank you for your patience during our busiest registration period.

Sincerely,
Student Information Systems

# Bad Crisis Communication Examples ❌

## Example 1: Vague and Unhelpful

**Subject:** System Issues

**Message:**
Hi,

We're having some problems with the system. We're working on it.

Thanks.

**Why This Is Bad:**
- No specific information about what's affected
- No timeline or expectations set
- No alternative actions provided
- No contact information for questions
- Doesn't acknowledge educational impact

---

## Example 2: Too Technical and Overwhelming

**Subject:** Database Cluster Failover Event in Production Environment

**Message:**
Users,

At 14:00 UTC, our primary PostgreSQL cluster experienced a cascading failure due to memory exhaustion on the master node, triggering an automatic failover to the secondary read replica which was not properly configured for write operations, resulting in database inconsistencies that required manual intervention to resolve through WAL replay and index rebuilding procedures.

Technical Details:
- Error logs show OOM killer terminated postgres processes
- Replication lag increased to 45 seconds before failover
- Connection pooling configuration limits were exceeded
- Vacuum operations were delayed causing table bloat

Resolution involved reconfiguring pgbouncer parameters and implementing connection throttling.

System restored at 16:23 UTC.

IT Operations

**Why This Is Bad:**
- Overly technical language inappropriate for educational audience
- No explanation of educational impact
- No information about what users should do
- No empathy for learning disruption
- Focuses on technical details rather than user needs
```

This comprehensive communication framework ensures clear, timely, and effective communication across all aspects of LMS team management and educational project delivery.
