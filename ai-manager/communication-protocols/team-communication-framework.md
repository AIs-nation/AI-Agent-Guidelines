### ‚ùå Poor Communication Examples

**Ineffective Problem Report:**
```
Something's broken, not sure what. Users complaining.
```
*Issues: No specifics, no impact assessment, no ownership, no timeline*

**Unclear Status Update:**
```
Working on the thing we discussed. Should be done soon.
```
*Issues: No specific task identified, no concrete timeline, no progress details*

**Unproductive Meeting Request:**
```
Can we meet about the project?
```
*Issues: No agenda, no purpose, no duration, no preparation guidance*
