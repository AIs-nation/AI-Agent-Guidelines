  // Code Review Communication
  codeReviewCommunication: {
    guidelines: [
      'Review within 24 hours during weekdays',
      'Constructive feedback with suggestions',
      'Explain the "why" behind requested changes',
      'Approve when ready, request changes clearly',
      'Use educational context in examples'
    ],
    
    goodReviewExample: `
    ## Code Review: User Progress Tracking Component
    
    ### ✅ What Works Well
    - Clean component structure with proper separation of concerns
    - Good use of React hooks for state management
    - Comprehensive prop validation
    
    ### 🔧 Suggestions for Improvement
    
    **Performance Optimization:**
    - Consider memoizing the progress calculation in line 45
    - \`useMemo(() => calculateProgress(lessons), [lessons])\`
    - This prevents recalculation on every render
    
    **Educational UX Enhancement:**
    - The progress bar could show more granular feedback
    - Consider adding micro-animations for completion milestones
    - Reference: Educational psychology shows visual feedback improves retention
    
    **Code Quality:**
    - Extract magic numbers to constants (line 67: \`percentage > 75\`)
    - Add error boundary for progress calculation failures
    
    ### 🎯 Next Steps
    Once addressed, this will significantly improve the student experience.
    Great work on the accessibility features! 🎉

    ## Technical Discussion: Assessment Data Storage Architecture
    
    ### 🎯 Problem
    Need to store assessment results with the following requirements:
    - Support for various question types (multiple choice, essay, coding)
    - Real-time progress tracking during assessment
    - Historical data for learning analytics
    - FERPA compliance for student data protection
    
    ### 📚 Educational Context
    - Students may take assessments multiple times
    - Instructors need detailed analytics on question performance
    - System must handle 500+ concurrent assessment takers
    
    ### 🔧 Technical Options
    
    **Option 1: MongoDB Document Store**
    ✅ Flexible schema for different question types
    ✅ Good performance for real-time updates
    ❌ Complex queries for analytics
    ❌ Less familiar to team
    
    **Option 2: PostgreSQL with JSONB**
    ✅ Team expertise with PostgreSQL
    ✅ Strong consistency and ACID compliance
    ✅ Advanced query capabilities for analytics
    ❌ More complex schema migrations
    
    **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
    ✅ PostgreSQL for core data + Redis for real-time updates
    ✅ Best of both worlds
    ❌ Increased complexity and maintenance
    
    ### 🏆 Recommendation: Option 2 (PostgreSQL + JSONB)
    
    **Reasoning:**
    - Leverages team's existing expertise
    - JSONB provides flexibility while maintaining query power
    - Strong consistency crucial for assessment integrity
    - Easier compliance implementation
    
    **Implementation Plan:**
    1. Design normalized schema for core assessment data
    2. Use JSONB columns for question-specific data
    3. Implement real-time updates via WebSocket + database triggers
    4. Create analytics views for instructor dashboard
    
    **Timeline:** 2 sprints (4 weeks)
    **Dependencies:** Database migration scripts, API design review
    
    ### 💬 Feedback Requested
    - @backend-team: Thoughts on JSONB performance for our scale?
    - @frontend-team: Any client-side considerations?
    - @devops: Infrastructure implications?
    
    **Decision Deadline:** Friday EOD

#### ❌ DON'T: Over-communicate or Under-communicate
```javascript
// Avoid these communication patterns
const badCommunicationPatterns = {
  overCommunication: [
    'Multiple daily meetings covering same topics',
    'Excessive Slack notifications for minor updates',
    'CC\'ing entire team on every email',
    'Detailed progress reports for trivial tasks'
  ],

  underCommunication: [
    'Making technical decisions without team input',
    'Silent on blockers until they become critical',
    'No updates for days when working on complex features',
    'Skipping stakeholder updates during crucial phases'
  ],

  inconsistentCommunication: [
    'Random meeting times that change frequently',
    'Different update formats for same stakeholder group',
    'Mixing urgent and non-urgent communications',
    'No clear escalation paths for issues'
  ]
};
```

### Meeting Effectiveness DO's and DON'Ts

#### ✅ DO: Run Efficient, Purpose-Driven Meetings
```javascript
// Effective meeting structure for LMS projects
const effectiveMeetingStructure = {
  preparation: {
    agenda: 'Shared 24 hours before meeting',
    materials: 'Pre-read documents linked in agenda',
    objectives: 'Clear outcomes defined',
    timeboxing: 'Each agenda item has allocated time'
  },

  execution: {
    punctuality: 'Start and end on time',
    participation: 'Engage all attendees appropriately',
    decisions: 'Document decisions with owners and timelines',
    parking_lot: 'Capture off-topic items for follow-up'
  },

  followUp: {
    summary: 'Action items shared within 2 hours',
    accountability: 'Clear owners and deadlines',
    progress: 'Check-in on action items in next meeting'
  },

  meetingTypes: {
    standup: {
      duration: '15 minutes maximum',
      focus: 'Yesterday, today, blockers',
      format: 'Round-robin, time-boxed updates'
    },

    retrospective: {
      duration: '60 minutes',
      focus: 'What went well, what didn\'t, action items',
      format: 'Structured facilitation with concrete outcomes'
    },

    technical_review: {
      duration: '90 minutes',
      focus: 'Architecture decisions, code quality, technical debt',
      format: 'Demo + discussion + decision documentation'
    }
  }
};
```

#### ❌ DON'T: Run Unproductive Meetings
```javascript
// Avoid these meeting anti-patterns
const badMeetingPatterns = {
  preparation: [
    'No agenda shared beforehand',
    'Unclear meeting objectives',
    'Inviting people who don\'t need to be there',
    'Scheduling back-to-back meetings without breaks'
  ],

  execution: [
    'Starting late or running over time',
    'Allowing one person to dominate discussion',
    'Making decisions without proper input',
    'Going off-topic without parking lot'
  ],

  followUp: [
    'No meeting summary or action items',
    'Unclear ownership of decisions',
    'Not following up on previous action items',
    'Repeating same discussions in multiple meetings'
  ]
};
```

### Crisis Communication DO's and DON'Ts

#### ✅ DO: Implement Clear Crisis Communication Protocols
```javascript
// Educational crisis communication framework
const crisisCommunicationProtocol = {
  detection: {
    monitoring: 'Automated alerts + manual observation',
    classification: 'Severity levels with clear definitions',
    escalation: 'Clear chain of command',
    timeframe: 'Response time based on severity'
  },

  response: {
    immediate: 'Contain the issue and assess impact',
    communication: 'Inform stakeholders with accurate information',
    coordination: 'Establish war room for complex issues',
    documentation: 'Record timeline and actions for post-mortem'
  },

  recovery: {
    resolution: 'Fix the root cause, not just symptoms',
    verification: 'Test thoroughly before declaring resolved',
    postMortem: 'Document lessons learned',
    prevention: 'Implement safeguards to prevent recurrence'
  },

  stakeholderManagement: {
    students: 'Clear, simple communication about impact',
    instructors: 'Workarounds and timeline for resolution',
    administrators: 'Business impact and mitigation steps',
    technical: 'Detailed technical information and progress'
  }
};
```

#### ❌ DON'T: Handle Crises Poorly
```javascript
// Avoid these crisis communication mistakes
const crisisCommunicationMistakes = {
  communication: [
    'Delayed notification to stakeholders',
    'Vague or contradictory information',
    'Over-promising on resolution timeline',
    'Blame attribution during active crisis'
  ],

  technical: [
    'Making hasty fixes without proper testing',
    'Not preserving evidence for post-mortem',
    'Working in isolation without coordination',
    'Focusing on blame instead of resolution'
  ],

  stakeholder: [
    'Using technical jargon with non-technical stakeholders',
    'Not providing regular updates during resolution',
    'Forgetting to communicate when crisis is resolved',
    'Not following up with lessons learned'
  ]
};
```
