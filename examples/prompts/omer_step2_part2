Now to step 2. THIS STEP IS RESEARCH AND SUMMARY ONLY! I want you to look at the AI-Agent-Guidelines you will find there the research that you already did related to how to be a developer, a security engineer and how to be a manager, You will also find a todo list in the frontend and backend inside the lms folder under todo.txt in each of them. I now want you to make a specific research on the things required to complete the LMS project specifically. For example you will create a folder under AI-Agent-Guidelines and under ai-developer called "react-best-practice" because it's important you will know react in deep understanding. In this folder you will write how react work and the best way you could use it. another example is that under AI-Agent-Guidelines and under ai-manager you will create a subfolder called "communications-protocol" in there you will put best practices for how to communicate both with your workers and with your manager, with good and bad examples just like you do in your scratchpad. You will decide which datasets are the most important for you to complete the LMS project properly, you will be creating the guide that eventually you, your workers and your managers will be doing, so make it as elaborate as you can to make sure that everyone will be on the right page so they can contribute the LMS project.
