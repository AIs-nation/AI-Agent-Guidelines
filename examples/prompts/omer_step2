Now to step 2. THIS STEP IS RESEARCH AND SUMMARY ONLY! I want you to look for 1. best coding practices. 2. Secure coding practices. 3. Management and leadership best practices. Research those online and summaries your finding in AI-Agent-Guidelines under the relevant folders ai-developer ai-security ai-manager put under each one the best practices that you find KEEP RESEARCHING THE WEB FOREVER, SEARCH DIFFERENT TERMS EACH TIME SO YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE A FULL TUTORIAL FOR AI AGENTS HOW THEY SHOULD BEHAVE EXAMPLE: the tutorial of mangers must include that the manager must keep constant clear and precise contact with all employees to make sure they are doing what they are suppose to, the way they are suppose to. I want to make it easy for you, why recreate the bible when it's already written, just clone repos that you find online, download online resources - pdf and other files right to the folders. I think you will agree that you don't have to rewrite all of this again. Actually, I DON'T WANT YOU TO CLONE ALL THE FILES IT WILL MAKE A MESS, JUST MAKE A FILE OF RESOURCES WITH LINKS TO ALL THE RELEVANT RESOURCES.
