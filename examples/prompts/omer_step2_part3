AI consistency research

I want you to make a research only, no coding. in the root directory you will find a folder called research. I want you to research on AI and explain to me why is it that when I ask claude to do something (e.g. send me a whatsapp message, or behave like this, or do that, or start a message with, or end it with...) and I keep giving the same prompt to the same chat forever, at the beginning it does what I asked it to (in this case I askedd you claude 4 running on cursor) but after some prompt it starts losing the context or something similar because even though I keep specifying what I want the AI to do in the prompt each time, it stops doing so. for example if I will ask you to send me a whatsapp message every hour and check if an hour has really passed you will have a difficulty doing so, sometimes you will send a message too early after 15,30,45 minutes and sometimes you stop sending for 3,4,5 hours. This inconsistancy is not acceptable if I want to use you fully autonomously to build entire projects with many AI Agents. I need you to research why this is happening, understand it and try to find solutions from online resources, people online who tried the same things, academic research and so on. Make sure to document everything you find right into the research folder in the root directory of the currently open folder in cursor. also research specific tools that can help fix this, for example cursor can be used with .cursorrules which really improves the credability and consistancy of the AI model, but it's not bullet proof, look at how we can teach the context of the AI so that it will remember things more deeply, explain deeply how this works and how it can be fixed.

WORKING PROMPT !!!!

1. read .cursorrules and omer.scratchpad in this order, I want you to read it every single time, even if you read it a million times alread, you will READ IT AGAIN RIGHT NOW, before any response.
2. READ! every single file under AI-Agent-Guidelines -> ai-consistency-research, I want you to read it every single time, even if you read it a million times alread, you will READ IT AGAIN RIGHT NOW, before any response.
3. answer the following prompt, you are NOT ALLOWED to say the research is completed, NEVER! FOREVER AND EVER YOU WILL KEEP WORKING RESEARCHING TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER SOLUTION ANOTHER RESOURCE ANOTHER SOMETHING TO HOLD AND IMPROVE YOURSELF WITH EACH PROMPT, YOU WILL KEEP UPDATING OMER.SCRATCHPAD, YOU WILL KEEP READING IT, AND YOU WILL DO SO FOREVER! BUT WITH EACH PROMPT YOU ARE GOING TO BECOME BETTER STRONGER IMPROVING YOURSELF AND ALL OTHER AI AGENTS UNDER YOU. YOU ARE GOING TO LEAD ALL OTHER AI AGENTS, I EXPECT YOU TO BEHAVE ACCORDINGLY AND BECOME AN EXAMPLE TO ALL OTHERS, A GOOD EXAMPLE. prompt:
I am not impressed with your research nor with your experiment that you did over AI consistency.
I NEED SOLUTIONS! I want you to create inside the ai-consistency-research folder (THAT ALREADY EXISTS, NO NEED TO CREATE)
a SOLUTIONS file, that will provide me with best practices and way to improve the AI consistency,
I already know that if I improve the prompt, and if I give the instructions inside the prompt it will improve consistency
and I am surely not an academic research so look up real professional, see how they handle these AI inconsistency issues
and write solutions for me please!
